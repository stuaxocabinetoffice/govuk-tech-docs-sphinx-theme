# GOV.UK Tech Docs Sphinx Theme

A Sphinx theme to replicate the GOV.UK Tech Docs Template.

```{warning}

Where this documentation refers to the root folder we mean where this README.md is located.

```

This is a fork of [govuk-tech-docs-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govuk-tech-docs-sphinx-theme) incorporating patches by Eric Young, Dan Milne, and Stuart Axon:

- Python 3.11-3.13 support (dropped 3.6-3.10)
- Sphinx 8.2+ compatibility
- Updated GitHub Actions and dependencies
- Fixed theme registration and packaging
- Accessibility statement corrections

## Getting started

The source code for this Sphinx theme is available at
[`https://github.com/stuart-axon/govuk-tech-docs-sphinx-theme`][repository].  You
can use this for your own Sphinx documentation by following the steps below.

### Install the package

The latest released version can be installed from the [Python Package Index
(PyPI)][pypi]:

```shell
pip install govuk-tech-docs-sphinx-theme
```

### Amend your Sphinx `conf.py` configuration file

To use this Sphinx theme, modify your Sphinx `conf.py` configuration file as follows:

1. Add the theme in the list of `extensions`:
   ```python
   extensions = ["govuk_tech_docs_sphinx_theme"]
   ```
2. Make sure the `author`, and `project` variables reflect your organisation name, and
   project
3. Set `html_theme = "govuk_tech_docs_sphinx_theme"`
4. Set the `html_context` dictionary as follows:
   ```python
   html_context = {
       "github_url": None,                  # if using GitHub, set to the URL of your repository as a string
       "gitlab_url": None,                  # if using GitLab, set to the URL of your repository as a string
       "conf_py_path": "docs/",             # assuming your Sphinx folder is called `docs`
       "version": "main",                   # assuming `main` is your repository's default branch
       "accessibility": "accessibility.md"  # assuming your accessibility statement is at `docs/accessibility.md`
   }
   ```
5. Set the `html_theme_options` dictionary as follows:
   ```python
   html_theme_options = {
       "organisation": "",  # replace with your organisation's abbreviation (ideally) or name - long text may not look nice
       "phase": ""          # replace with an Agile project phase - see https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery
   }
   ```

Note, not all Sphinx configuration settings are currently supported by this theme —

### Add an accessibility statement

````{note} Accessibility issues with Sphinx autodoc extension

With the Sphinx autodoc extension, you may find headers do not fit the content that
follows. This [fails the WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 Headings and
Labels][wcag-2.1-2.4.6].

To resolve this, copy the entire `docs/_template` folder from this repository into
your Sphinx folder, and ensure your `conf.py` file contains:

```python
templates_path = ["_templates"]
```

````

All public sector bodies have to meet the [2018 accessibility
regulations][govuk-accessibility] unless exempt.

To add an accessibility statement, create a blank Markdown file in the root of your
Sphinx folder called `accessibility.md`. This folder is the same location as your
Sphinx `conf.py` configuration file. Add the following header to your new Markdown file:

```markdown
---
orphan: true
---
# Accessibility statement
```

followed by your accesibility statement. [Guidance on how to write an accessibility
statement can be found on GOV.UK][govuk-example-accessibility].

Next, in your Sphinx `conf.py` file, check that the `html_context` variable has this
file referenced, i.e.:

```python
html_context = {
    ...,
    "accessibility": "accessibility.md",
    ...
}
```

### Apply the theme's components

This theme should be compatible with most ReStructuredText syntax, and also includes
[components from the GOV.UK Design System][govuk-design]. [See the example
components page for further details][docs-example-components-rest].

[If you are using MyST to build Sphinx documentation using Markdown][myst], see
the [equivalent Markdown components page][docs-example-components-md].
